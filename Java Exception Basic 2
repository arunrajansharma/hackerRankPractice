Create a class myCalculator which consists of a single method power(int,int). This method takes two integers, nn and pp, as parameters and finds npnp. If either nn or pp is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "n and p should be non-negative".

Please read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. Your code mustn't be public.

No need to worry about constraints, there won't be any overflow if your code is correct.

//Write your code here




class myCalculator {
    int power(int n, int p) throws Exception{
        if(n <0 || p <0){
            throw new Exception("n and p should be non-negative");
        }
        else{
            int result = 1;
            for(int i=1;i<=p;i++){
                result *= n;
            }
            return result;
        }
    }
    
}
